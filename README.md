# HypothesisFootnotes
Transform Hypothesis direct links into inline footnotes

The script that's included in a web page, footnotes.js, is derived from footnotes.ts, which uses TypeScript type annotations to add a bit of rigor to the code. If you care about that and want to modify footnotes.js, install TypeScript (https://github.com/judell/HypothesisFootnotes) and use `tsc` to transpile footnotes.ts to footnotes.js. If you don't care about TypeScript, which is perfectly OK, then you can just work directly in footnotes.js.
